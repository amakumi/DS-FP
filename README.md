# At a glance

Education is mandatory for all people. Young people are required to gain essential knowledge through education per se as a stepping stone before they venture into their adult lives. This is why there are education levels according to the age group for instance children, teenagers, and young adults. One of the most paramount phases of education of humans is during their high schools. There are various factors and aspects which would determine a student’s performance regarding their grades in school. Prediction of student’s performance became an urgent desire in most educational entities and institutes. That is essential in order to help at-risk students and assure their retention, providing the excellent learning resources and experience, and improving the university’s ranking and reputation. Despite that, there is an uncertainty where each aspect and factor might come into play and contribute to an individual’s grade performance. There might be several factors which might be relevant and some other factors which could show the opposite. With that being said, the researchers proposed this project with the intention to solve these uncertainties and to determine crucial factors which would eventually impact a student’s overall grades. The method to determine the crucial factors is the pairwise correlation matrix.
